    Q1 : <p>Complete the function in the editor. 
        In which you are given one object as a parameter, in that object, there is a data member named 
        n
        a
        m
        e
        . Your task is to create a method inside this object named 
        s
        e
        t
        t
        e
        r
        , such that this method will print the value of the data member named as 
        n
        a
        m
        e
        .</p>
    Ans : <code>function Check(obj1){ <br>
        obj1.setter = function () {<br>
          console.log(this.name);<br>
        }
     }</code>

    Q2 : <p>Complete the function in the editor. You have an object 
        as a parameter. In which you have to delete the rollno property
         from the object and return the object.</p>
    Ans : <code>function Check(obj1) {<br>
        delete obj1.rollno;<br>
        return obj1;<br>
      }</code>

    Q3 : <p>Complete the function in the editor. In which you are given an object as a parameter.
        In that object, there is one property named as salary if the salary is maximum than 5 lakh
         then return "Dream" otherwise  return "NotDream".</p>

    Ans : <code>function Check(obj1) {<br>
        if(obj1.salary > 500000) {<br>
          return "Dream";<br>
        }<br>
        
        
        return "NotDream";<br>
    }</code>

    Q4 : <p>Complete the function in the editor. In which you are given an object as
         a parameter. You have to return "false" if there is no parameter in the object otherwise return "true".</p>
    Ans : <code>function Check(obj1) {
   
        if((Object.keys(obj1)).length !== 0) {<br>
          return true;<br>
        } <br>
        
        return false;<br>
      }<br>
      </code>

    Q5 : <p>Complete the function in the editor. In which you are given 
        two objects as a parameter.In which you have to merge two objects and return a single object.</p>
    Ans : <code>function Check(obj1,obj2) {<br>
        for(const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj2)) {<br>
           obj1[key] = value;<br>
        }<br>
        
        return obj1;<br>
    }</code>

    Q6 : <p>Complete the function in the editor. In which you are given an object and a digit N as a parameter.
        In the object there are two variable id and houseno
         are defined as a data member. You have to multiply both the data members with a given digit N.</p>
    Ans : <code>function Check(obj1,obj2) {<br>
        for(const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj2)) {<br>
           obj1[key] = value;<br>
        }
        <br>
        return obj1;<br>
    }</code>

    Q7 : <p>You are given a function Check which takes an object 
        O
        b
        j
         as a parameter.
        Your taks is to find out the sum of the three data members of the object. The data members are named as p1, p2, p3.</p>
    Ans : <code>function Check(obj1) {<br>
        return obj1.p1 + obj1.p2 + obj1.p3;<br>
    }</code>

    Q8: <p>Complete the function in the editor. In which you are given an object as a parameter.
         That object contains two variables name and id.
        Your task is to compare the object name and id to the new_name and new_id given there as a parameter.
        Return "true" if new_name and id are same as objects name and id otherwise return  "false".</p>
    Ans : <code>function check(obj1,a,b) {<br>
        if(obj1.name === a && obj1.id === b) {<br>
          return true;<br>
        }<br>
        
        return false;<br>
    }</code>
